'
'
' This File contains a Class to store all video specific call.
'
' You could compile Tease-AI for only WMP or VLC by commenting USEWMP or USEVLC declaration.
' Note: if neither USEWMP nor USEVLC are set, there will be no video at all.
'
' When launching Tease-AI, use -VLC or -WMP argument to chose. If both are set, VLC will
' be prefered. If one is set but Tease-AI was not compiled for it, it will be ignored.
' If no argument is set, there will be no video.
'
' The Idea is to compile for both and then make two shortcut :
' 1 - named TeaseAIWithWMP launching "Tease AI.exe -WMP"
' 2 - named TeaseAIWithVLC launching "Tease AI.exe -VLC"
'
' We could also force one by default in the VideoHandlerCreator if needed.
' 
' Note: Adding mediaEnded in state should be considered.
